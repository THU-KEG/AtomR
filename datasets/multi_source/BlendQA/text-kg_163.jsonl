Hundreds of thousands of Americans found themselves homeless , and began congregating in shanty towns -- dubbed `` Hoovervilles '' -- that began to appear across the country . In response , President Hoover and Congress approved the Federal Home Loan Bank Act , to spur new home construction , and reduce foreclosures . The final attempt of the Hoover Administration to stimulate the economy was the passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act ( ERA ) which included funds for public works programs such as dams and the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation ( RFC ) in 1932 . The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was a Federal agency with the authority to lend up to $2 billion to rescue banks and restore confidence in financial institutions . But $2 billion was not enough to save all the banks , and bank runs and bank failures continued . Quarter by quarter the economy went downhill , as prices , profits and employment fell , leading to the political realignment in 1932 that brought to power Franklin Delano Roosevelt .

Above that , a balcony was placed on each side , framed by pillars . Bartholdi placed an observation platform near the top of the pedestal , above which the statue itself rises . According to author Louis Auchincloss , the pedestal `` craggily evokes the power of an ancient Europe over which rises the dominating figure of the Statue of Liberty '' . The committee hired former army General Charles Pomeroy Stone to oversee the construction work . Construction on the 15 - foot - deep ( 4.6 m ) foundation began in 1883 , and the pedestal 's cornerstone was laid in 1884 . In Hunt 's original conception , the pedestal was to have been made of solid granite . Financial concerns again forced him to revise his plans ; the final design called for poured concrete walls , up to 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) thick , faced with granite blocks .

The tune was changed after the first series , and the new one was written by John Sullivan ( he disliked the tune for the first series , and his new one explained the show 's title ) , and Hazlehurst conducted it . It was recorded at Lime Grove on 11 May 1982 , with musicians John Horler , Dave Richmond , Bigden , and Proctor . Sullivan wanted the band Chas & Dave singing , but this was not possible due to their single Ai n't No Pleasing You being successful in the charts . Sullivan had intended for Chas & Dave to sing it because they had enjoyed success with the `` Rockney '' style , a mixture of rock n ' roll and traditional Cockney music . Sullivan was persuaded to do it himself by Ray Butt . Despite the creation of a new theme tune , the original one remained in occasional use . Chas & Dave did later contribute to the show , performing the closing credits song for the 1989 episode `` The Jolly Boys ' Outing '' .

They were played on massive computers connected to vector displays , not analog televisions . Ralph H. Baer conceived the idea of a home video game in 1951 . In the late 1960s , while working for Sanders Associates , Baer created a series of video game console designs . One of these designs , which gained the nickname of the 1966 `` Brown Box '' , featured changeable game modes and was demonstrated to several TV manufacturers , ultimately leading to an agreement between Sanders Associates and Magnavox . In 1972 , Magnavox released the Magnavox Odyssey , the first home video game console which could be connected to a TV set . Ralph Baer 's initial design had called for a huge row of switches that would allow players to turn on and off certain components of the console ( the Odyssey lacked a CPU ) to create slightly different games like tennis , volleyball , hockey , and chase . Magnavox replaced the switch design with separate cartridges for each game . Although Baer had sketched up ideas for cartridges that could include new components for new games , the carts released by Magnavox all served the same function as the switches and allowed players to choose from the Odyssey 's built - in games . </P>", "short_answer": "1972", "entity": "video game console", "entity_id": "Q8076", "answers": ["1972"]}

These glands produce the skunk 's spray , which is a mixture of sulfur - containing chemicals such as thiols ( traditionally called mercaptans ) , which have an offensive odor . A skunk 's spray is powerful enough to ward off bears and other potential attackers . Muscles located next to the scent glands allow them to spray with a high degree of accuracy , as far as 3 m ( 10 ft ) . The smell aside , the spray can cause irritation and even temporary blindness , and is sufficiently powerful to be detected by a human nose up to 5.6 km ( 3.5 miles ) down wind .
